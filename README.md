# Rovo Action for creating a Confluence page (under parent)

[![Apache 2.0 license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

Currently, the out-of-the-box actions for Confluence
do not create new pages _under_ a parent.
You can pick the Space,
but then you have to manually organize the page into the page hierarchy.
This Forge App is a Rovo Action that calls the REST API,
which can provide coordinates to a parent page.

At this time,
this code is example only,
with some important features
**not implemented**.
Specifically,
the code does not do anything to change LLM-produced Markdown
into the Atlassian Document Format.
